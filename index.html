 According to all known laws
    of aviation,


    there is no way a bee
    should be able to fly.


    Its wings are too small to get
    its fat little body off the ground.


    The bee, of course, flies anyway


    because bees don't care
    what humans think is impossible.


    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.


    Ooh, black and yellow!
    Let's shake it up a little. </p>
